# sRNAflow


The goal of this project is to develop the software tool for analysis of small RNA that fulfills the specific needs for samples derived from biofluids. Many existing tools for adapter removal, quality check, mapping reads, counting, differential expression analysis, non-template isomiRs search, and for prediction of the miRNA target will be integrated into it. New specific algorithms necessary for analyses of samples from biofluids will be included as well. Finalising results as a united report for all stages of workflow will be generated at the end of the complete process. Furthermore, the tool will be designed as user-friendly for inexperienced users.
